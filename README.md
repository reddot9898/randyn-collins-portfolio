# Randyn Collins Portfolio

## Description
This project was built to test my knowledge and skills on HTML and CSS. I have learned a lot in the past week and a half but have not grasp enough of the information just quite yet to finish this project.I have simply run out of time. BUt that will only motivate me and keep pushing me in the future to do better. Even though this project is incomplete it has positively shown me how fast and demanding building a web application can be and how you cannot waste anytime that you are givin. My motivation for this project was to further my skills and help me to start remembering all syntax in css and html.
